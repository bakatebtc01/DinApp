**Target Users:** 50-200 pilot users (NGO, church, market vendors, SACCOs)

---

## ⚡ EXPRESS DEPLOYMENT (30 minutes to live)

### PHASE 1: ONE-TIME SETUP (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Create Cloudflare Account** (5 min)

```bash
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up
2. Sign up (free tier)
3. Verify email
4. Note Account ID (Settings)
```

**Step 2: Create R2 Bucket** (3 min)

```bash
1. Dashboard → R2
2. Create bucket
3. Name: dinapp-apk
4. Create
```

**Step 3: Get API Token** (5 min)

```bash
1. Settings → API Tokens
2. Create Token
3. Permissions: Account.R2: Edit, Account.Cloudflare Pages: Edit
4. Copy token (save to password manager!)
```

**Step 4: Generate Keystore** (5 min)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Documents\GitHub\DinApp
.\scripts\generate-keystore.ps1
# Save password when prompted!
```

**Step 5: Backup Keystore NOW!** (2 min)

```
CRITICAL: This is your most important file!
- Copy dinapp.keystore to USB drive
- Upload to cloud backup (encrypted)
- Save password in password manager
IF YOU LOSE THIS = CANNOT UPDATE APP
```

### PHASE 2: GitHub Configuration (5 minutes)

Go to: GitHub Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add exactly these 5 secrets:

| Secret Name           | Value           | From                |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID | abc123xyz...    | Cloudflare Settings |
| CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN  | v1.0_abc...     | API Tokens          |
| KEYSTORE_PASSWORD     | YourPassword123 | Keystore generation |
| KEY_ALIAS             | dinapp          | (literal)           |
| KEY_PASSWORD          | YourPassword123 | Keystore generation |

### PHASE 3: Deploy (5 minutes execution + 15 min wait)

```bash
cd C:\Users\ADMIN\Documents\GitHub\DinApp
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy DinApp v0.1 MVP - Early Access"
git push origin main
```

**Wait for GitHub Actions** (check Actions tab):

- ✅ Build APK
- ✅ Sign with keystore
- ✅ Upload to Cloudflare
- ✅ Deploy web page
- ✅ Create release

**Total workflow time:** ~15 minutes

---

## 🌐 CLOUDFLARE TEST APP (PREVIEW FIRST)

Before distributing the APK broadly, run a **test app** deployment on Cloudflare Pages to validate the download flow and metadata:

```bash
# From repo root
cd /workspace/DinApp

# Ensure Cloudflare is authenticated
npx wrangler whoami

# Deploy the static download page (preview)
npx wrangler pages deploy ./frontend/out --project-name dinapp-apk-preview
```

**Preview checks:**

- ✅ Download button points to the correct APK.
- ✅ Version and release notes display properly.
- ✅ Mobile browser download works end-to-end.

If the preview looks correct, proceed with the full deployment steps above.

---

## 🧪 DEBUG APK VALIDATION (MVP HARDENING)

Before shipping the Early Access APK, create and validate the **debug build** to catch regressions quickly:

```bash
cd mobile
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

**Debug APK path:**

```
mobile/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Debug Fix Checklist

- ✅ App launches to home screen without crash.
- ✅ Login/Signup screens load and accept input.
- ✅ Permissions prompts function (push, SMS, audio).
- ✅ Network requests show friendly error states when offline.
- ✅ Wallet and QR flows navigate without dead-ends.

If issues appear, resolve before signing the release APK.

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PLAN

1. Remove download link from circulation
2. Create new issue pinned in GitHub
3. Explain problem to users
4. Offer v0.1.1 hotfix OR v0.2 with fix
5. All handled transparently

Users CAN'T auto-update (we disabled that), so:

- You have time to fix things
- Users upgrade voluntarily
- No surprises
