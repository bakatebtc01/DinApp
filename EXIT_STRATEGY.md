# DINAPP – EXIT & LICENSING STRATEGY (POST-SANDBOX)

**Version:** 1.0 (Regulator-Aligned | Investor-Ready)

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS STRATEGY
This document outlines how DinApp will:
- Exit the regulatory sandbox responsibly.
- Transition into appropriate licensing (if required).
- Scale operations without introducing systemic risk.
- Remain compliant while expanding services and geography.

*This strategy is aligned with expectations of Bank of Papua New Guinea and comparable regulators in emerging markets.*

---

## 2. PRINCIPLES GOVERNING EXIT
DinApp’s post-sandbox transition is governed by five principles:
1.  **No regulatory arbitrage.**
2.  **No deposit-taking without license.**
3.  **No lending risk on balance sheet.**
4.  **Platform-only monetisation.**
5.  **Phased, permission-based scaling.**

---

## 3. SANDBOX EXIT CRITERIA (TRIGGERS)
DinApp will initiate sandbox exit when all of the following are met:
- Successful completion of sandbox KPIs.
- No unresolved AML/CFT incidents.
- Ledger integrity validated (0 reconciliation failures).
- Agent network operating without abuse.
- Consumer complaints within acceptable thresholds.
- Regulator acknowledgement of sandbox completion.

*Exit occurs only with regulator concurrence.*

---

## 4. POST-SANDBOX OPERATING STATUS
### Immediate Post-Sandbox State
DinApp continues operating as:
*A digital financial marketplace platform providing wallets, escrow, transaction processing, and agent-based payouts.*

*DinApp does not automatically become a licensed bank or EMI upon sandbox exit.*

---

## 5. LICENSING PATHWAYS (MODULAR, NOT MONOLITHIC)
DinApp follows a modular licensing strategy, not a single heavy license.

### 5.1 Likely Licensing Categories (If Required)
Depending on regulator guidance, DinApp may apply for:
- Payment Service Provider / Payment Facilitator.
- Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) – *only if wallet float rules require*.
- Agent Network Operator approval.
- Digital Marketplace / Platform registration.

**⚠️ DinApp will not apply for:**
- Commercial banking license.
- Lending license (*unless business model changes*).

## 6. SERVICE-BY-SERVICE LICENSING LOGIC
| DinApp Service | Licensing Position |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Wallets** | Platform wallets, not deposits |
| **QR Scan-to-Pay** | Payment facilitation |
| **Livestreaming & Gifting** | Digital services |
| **Subscriptions** | Digital service billing |
| **Borrow & Lend** | Marketplace only (no lending) |
| **Agent Cash-Out** | Delegated under platform |
| **Escrow** | Transactional, time-bound |

*Licensing is pursued only where explicitly required.*

---

## 7. AGENT & SUB-LICENSE SCALING POST-SANDBOX
### Agent Expansion Rules
- Gradual increase in agent count.
- Regional caps during early expansion.
- Continuous audits.
- Mandatory retraining cycles.

### Sub-Licensing Control
- Agents remain under DinApp compliance.
- No independent branding without approval.
- Central AML & reporting retained by DinApp.

---

## 8. CAPITAL & SAFEGUARDS POST-SANDBOX
### Safeguards Maintained
- Wallet balance limits (tier-based).
- Transaction velocity caps.
- Earnings holds for risk events.
- Mandatory KYC for withdrawals.

### Capital Discipline
- No customer funds used for operations.
- Clear segregation of:
    - User wallets
    - Agent float
    - Platform revenue

---

## 9. GOVERNANCE & REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT
Post-sandbox, DinApp commits to:
- Named Compliance Officer.
- Regular regulator briefings (quarterly or as required).
- Incident reporting protocol.
- Annual independent audits (if requested).

*This positions DinApp as cooperative, not adversarial.*

---

## 10. GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION STRATEGY
### Phase 1 – Domestic Scale
- Expand within Papua New Guinea.
- Strengthen agent network.
- Increase creator and vendor density.

### Phase 2 – Regional Expansion
- Pacific Islands.
- Southeast Asia.
- Africa (select markets).

*Each new country uses same core platform, applies local regulatory wrapper, and requires separate regulatory approval.*

---

## 11. WHAT HAPPENS IF REGULATION CHANGES?
DinApp is designed to:
- Disable features by jurisdiction.
- Adjust limits instantly.
- Pause services without breaking wallets.
- Comply without full system rebuild.

*This is a future-proof architecture.*

---

## 12. INVESTOR ASSURANCE STATEMENT
From an investor perspective:
- No lending capital risk.
- No deposit liability.
- Predictable regulatory costs.
- Scalable compliance.
- Optional licensing, not mandatory overreach.

*This protects valuation and exit optionality.*

---

## 13. FINAL POSITIONING STATEMENT
“DinApp exits the sandbox as a compliant, auditable, and scalable financial marketplace platform. Licensing is pursued incrementally, service-by-service, in line with regulatory guidance, without exposing the platform to banking or credit risk.”
